# Bubble Shooter

Welcome to my pet project, a classic Bubble Shooter game built with React and the powerful framer-motion library. The purpose of this project was to experiment with the different features of framer-motion and to master its functionality.

This game holds a special place in my heart as it brings back memories of my primary school days where I used to play the same game and have a great time.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed building it.
